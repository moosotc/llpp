MuPDF[1] rendering library is used to do the actual work, so it needs
to be built and installed to use llpp.

MuPDF is included as a git submodule, which needs to be initialized
before building llpp. This is done with the following two commands
  git submodule init
  git submodule update --recursive

After that, change into the MuPDF directory and build it:
  cd mupdf
  make

llpp also depends on OCaml[2] (version 4.02.x), LablGL[3] having a C
compiler wouldn't hurt either.
         * MuPDF depends on libcrypto[4] part of openssl
         * Building LablGL from sources requires camlp4[5]
